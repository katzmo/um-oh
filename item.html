          <p>
            The Venus of Willendorf is a small statuette, estimated to have been
            carved 29,500 years ago. It was recovered in 1908 from an
            archeological dig near Willendorf, Austria. The statuette is 11.1 cm
            (4.4 inches) tall and is made from oolitic limestone, originally
            colored with red ochre. Similar figures have been found from France
            to Russia.

                Yes! The figure played an important part in early spiritual
                practices. The body shape indicates a symbol of fertiliy,
                perhaps it represented a godess watching over the cycle of life.

                Exactly! Feminists consider it the Great Mother turned into
                stone in support of the matriarchal theory. It counters
                patriachal narratives by celebrating female power.

                That‘s right. The statue might be a self-carved image reflecting
                how prehistoric women saw themselves, distorted by their
                viewpoint of their own body.
